## **IMPORTANCE OF GIT**
Git is a content tracker.
So Git can be used to store content,
and it is mostly used to store code because of the other features it provides.
Real life projects generally have multiple developers working in parallel.
So they need a version control system like Git.
To make sure that there are no code conflicts between them.
So, a version control system allows developers to revert and go back to an older version of their code.
It allows you to have track of all the changes by different contributors to your project.
### **Repository**
A repository is just a file location where you are storing all the files related to your project.
In our case a repository will contain code-based files.
A repository in Git could be considered similar to your project folder.
Git could track all the changes happening inside the folder.
## **WHY DO WE NEED GIT?**
### **Track Changes**
When various people collaborate on a project,
it’s hard to keep track of revisions.
Like who changed what, when, and where those files are stored.
GitHub takes care of this problem by keeping track of all the changes that have been pushed to the repository.
Main concern is to keep track of things.
Suppose you’re working on feature A, nothing else should be affected by your unfinished code.
What if it turns out the feature isn’t necessary anymore?
What if after 10 commits, you notice that you took the completely wrong approach?
Git is the first one to make it work as it is: fast & easy.
Branching is the answer for these problems.
### **Save Time**
Imagine that, every time before moving your mouse, you’d have to wait for 5 seconds.
It's quite annoying, right?
With version control it’s quite the same – we’re also only talking about a few seconds per command, but it quickly adds up in your work day.
Git, however, is very fast.
### **Undo Mistakes**
Sometimes you make mistakes.The best about Git is that there’s a little “undo” command for almost every situation.
Correct your last commit because you forgot to include that small change.
Revert a whole commit because that feature isn’t necessary, anymore.
You can even restore “deleted” commits.
