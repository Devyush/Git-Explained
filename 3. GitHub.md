## **WHAT IS GITHUB?**
Do you remember the man hired for keeping all the records for the friends team?
He needs a place, an environment where he will do all the tracking work.
And everyone can visit and make changes whenever they want.
Similar to that man, we have GIT.
And GIT needs a place to host the repository or workplace for everyone.
Here, GitHub comes into the picture.
There are two ways you can host your repositories.
One is online that is on the cloud.
And the second is offline that is self-installed on your server.
We will learn about the most popular Git hosting service:
**GitHub-owned by Microsoft**.
GitHub is a Git repository hosting service.
It hosts the service for everyone like you host a party.
And also provides a web-based graphical interface.
It helps every team member to work together on the project from anywhere and makes it easy for them to collaborate.
GitHub helps all the team members to stay on the same page and stay organized.
## **WHY GITHUB?**
Now you know that, GitHub allows you to keep both local and remote copies of your project.
A project that you can publish it among your team members as they can use it and update it from there itself.
### **Largest Shared Repository**
The repository is so large that it has 25Million users,
which is actually more than the population of some country.
It is the worldâ€™s largest software development platform.
### **Exposure**
Putting your project to a shared, public repository makes it instantly discoverable for those 25M users.
Github provides simply unmatched exposure and insights compared to any other platform.
And you can easily discover code written by others, learn from it, and even use it for your own projects.
### **Best version control**
Versions control on GitHub are very similar to MS Office or Google Drive.
It tracks all the changes or updates made to your project and who makes them.
You can always check the detailed changelog that neatly hosts all of the relevant information.
