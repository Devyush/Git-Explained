## **LOCAL TO REMOTE**
### **Local Repository**
Local repositories reside on the computers of team members.
If you're the only person working on your project, chances are you'll never need to set up a remote repository.
What if you want to share data with your teammates?
### **What is a remote Repository?**
Remote Repository comes in the rescue.
A remote repository in Git is a common repository that all team members use to exchange their changes.
Every member can access the repository and make changes which everyone can access.
In most cases, such a remote repository is stored on a code hosting service like **GitHub** or on an internal server.
We have been working only in the local repository.
Each developer will work in their local repository but eventually, they will push the code into a remote repository.
Once the code is in the remote repository, other developers can see and modify that code.
I hope you remember how to create a new repository in GitHub.
Now you have a local repository but want to convert it into a Remote repository.
Lets see how.  

**Step 1:**
* After creating a repository on GIThub, you will get a URL for your repository.
* Copy that URL.

**Step 2:**
* Now to point your local repository to the remote repository, use the following command:
`git remote add origin [repository url]`.
### **Git Push**
In order to push all the code from the local repository into the remote repository, use the following command:
`git push -u origin master`.
This pushes the code from the master branch in the local repository to the master branch in the remote repository.
## **BRANCHING**
### **Dispute**
What if Ram made some changes in the script and the next day Sahil erased those changes to make his new update?
This is going to be a big cause of anger for Ram when he gets to know.
How are they gonna solve this problem?
### **What is Branching?**
You must be aware of the word branch or branching.
Branch in general, means either a large or a small division.
Branching is the practice of creating copies of programs or objects to work in parallel versions, retaining the original and working on the branch or making different changes to each.
Suppose you're working on a project.
You're going to have a bunch of different features or ideas in progress at any given time – some of which are ready to go, and others which are not.
Branching exists to help you manage this workflow.
### **Creating a Branch**
When you create a branch in your project, you're creating an environment where you can try out new ideas.
Changes you make on a branch don't affect the main branch, so you're free to experiment and commit changes.
This is also useful when we have multiple people working on a project.
Each person creates a branch for the feature or bug-fix they are working on and when they are finished they merge it back into the master branch.
## **PULL REQUEST**
What if you did some changes in your code stored in the repository?
So, I guess you want your team members to get notified about it,
Otherwise there will be some serious issue about you not informing them about it.
But are you really going to mail them or text them about the changes made?
### **What is pull request?**
Pull requests are a mechanism for a developer to notify team members that they have made some changes or completed a feature.
Once their feature branch is ready, the developer files a pull request.
This lets everybody involved know that they need to review the code and merge it into the master branch.
### **Discussion room**
So, the pull request is more than just a notification.
It's a kind of discussion room for discussing the changes made.
If there are any problems with the changes, teammates can post feedback in the pull request and even improve the feature by pushing follow-up commits.
### **What actually happens**
When you file a pull request, you’re requesting that another developer pulls a branch from your repository into their repository.
You need to provide 4 pieces of information to file a pull request:
* Source repository
* Source branch
* Destination repository
* Destination branch
## **MERGING**
I guess you know combining something to form a single entity is what Merge means.
In GIT Merging is a way of putting different history back together again.
The `git merge` command allows you to take the independent lines of development created by git branch and integrate them into a single branch.
To be more specific, merging takes the contents of a source branch and integrates them with a target branch.
The source branch history remains the same.
### **How it works**
`Git merge` will combine multiple sequences of commits into one unified history.
In the most frequent use cases, `git merge` is used to combine two branches.
Merge takes two commit pointers, usually the branch tips, and will find a common base commit between them.
Once Git finds a common base commit it will create a new "merge commit" that combines the changes of each queued merge commit sequence.
