### **Initializing a repository**
So, Deep is hired for keeping records of changes made by The 3 Friends.
But where is he gonna store the records?
He needs a place for everything!
Let's jump to repository.
### **Storage**
Repository comes for the rescue.
You already know that
A Git repository is a virtual storage of your project.
It allows you to save versions of your code, which you can access when needed.
### **What is initializing the storage?**
Deep needs storage or a place for storage.
So a place will be assigned to him.
Similarly a virtual storage i.e. Repository is assigned.
But how?
### **The command**
To create a new repo,
We will use the `git init` command.  
**git init** is a one-time command you use during the initial setup of a new repository.
Executing this command will create a new .git in your directory.
## **CLONING**
### **Cloning the repository**
You got your virtual storage or repository ready and you know how it's done.
What if you want the same repository on your local computer?
Repository can be cloned just like the youtube video you can download to watch it when you are offline.
### **How?**
**Step 1:**
* To clone a repository, go to the repository page which you want to clone.
* Press Clone or Download button.
* Copy the code or URL that appears after pressing the button.


**Step 2:**
* Press the following command to clone the repository:
`git clone <URL>`
* It would take a few seconds to clone the repository onto your system, and the cloning is done.
