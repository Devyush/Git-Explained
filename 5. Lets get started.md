## **IMPORTANT TERMINOLOGIES**
### **Git Bash**
In simple words, Git Bash is a command-line prompt for windows.
It allows users to type Git commands that make source code management easier through versioning and commit history.
### **The Working Tree**
The name itself tells what it means.
Working Tree is the area where you are currently working.
It is where your files live.
This area is also known as the “untracked” area of git.
### **Command**
One thing you should keep in mind is that the changes will not be saved until you explicitly save them.
Any changes to files will be updated and seen in the Working Tree.
To see what is in your working tree run the command: `git status`.
This command will show you two things:
* The files in your Working Tree.
* The files in your Staging Area.
### **Staging Area**
You remember Deep right!
The man hired by the friends team for keeping the records of updates and changes made.
One day Bhanu (friends member) made some changes in the project or updated the project.
So now any of the friends member wants to specifically see the changed part of the project?
What are they gonna do?
The Staging Area comes in picture, when Git starts tracking and saving changes that occur in files.
That is about it when it comes to the Staging Area.
You tell git that I want to track these specific files, then Git moves them from your Working Tree to the Staging Area.
Where you can access it.
## **MAKE CHANGES & COMMIT**
On GitHub, saved changes are called **commits**.
Each commit has an associated commit message.
It is a description explaining why a particular change was made.
Commit messages capture the history of your changes, so other contributors can understand what you’ve done and why.
### **Commit**
I guess you are aware of the word commit.
The "commit" command is basically used to save your changes to the local repository.
They are the core building block units of a Git project timeline.
You can think of Commits as snapshots or milestones along the timeline of your Git project.
They are created with the git commit command to capture the state of a project at that point in time.
You should know that Git Snapshots are always committed to the local repository.
### **Commit Commands**
There are two important commit commands:
* `Git commit`
* `Git add`

Now you’re ready to save a copy of the current state of the project, you make changes with `git add`.
After you’re satisfied with the made snapshot, you commit it to the project history with **git commit**.
