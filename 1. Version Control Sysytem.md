## **WHAT IS GIT?**
Meet The 3 Friends, Ram, Sahil and Tushar. Tushar is working on a project. And Sahil and Ram later joined him on the same project. Sometimes Sahil makeds some changes or adds to the project and sometimes Ram changes something in the project. But this was leading them to a meaningless project. Because they didn't have any record of what changes were made and when they were made or by whom they were made. Finally, they hired a man who will keep record of all the changes and updates made.
### **GIT**
GIT is a version control system. This basically means that Git is a content tracker. Just like the man hired by The 3 Friends. The purpose of git is to manage a project, or set of files, as they change overtime.
### **Version Control System**
Version Control System is a piece of software that helps teams or individuals manage their source code overtime. It tracks changes in a project so that if something breaks while you are working on it or any updates made. You can compare the difference between the current project and a previous version of the project.
## **HISTORY OF GIT**
### **Who invented?**
Linus Torvalds the developer of Linux,
Designed GIT in 2005.
### **How**
When the Relationship between the community that developed Linux kernel and the company that developed BitKeeper broke down,
This led Linus Torvalds to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper.
This tool was GIT.
### **Inside story**
The in-joke was that I name all my projects after myself, and this one was named ‘Git’.
Git is British slang for ‘stupid person’, Words by Torvalds.
There’s a made-up acronym for it, Global Information Tracker, but that’s really a ‘backronym’.
These were the words of Linus Torvalds himself.
